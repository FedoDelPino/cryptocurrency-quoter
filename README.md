# Cryptocurrency Quoter App (ReactJS)

Hi, this is an app for "Cryptocurrency", based on the quotation of some local currencies. This app is development by [ReactJS](https://es.reactjs.org), Styled Components, and some request to [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) API. Also, it's created based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
The deployment is up through [Netlify](https://silly-dragon-41b3f8.netlify.app/)
